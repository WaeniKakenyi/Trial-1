            <p>Coffee preparation is the process of turning <a href="images/coffee-beans.jpg" target="_blank"> coffee beans</a> into a beverage. While the particular steps vary with the type of coffee and with the raw materials, the process includes four basic steps; raw coffee beans must be <a href="roasting.html" target="_blank"> roasted</a>, the roasted coffee beans must then be <a href="grinding.html" target="_blank"> ground</a>, the ground coffee must then be mixed with hot water for a certain time <a href="brewing.html" target="_blank" >(brewed)</a>, and finally the liquid coffee must be separated from the used grounds.</p>

            <p>Coffee is usually <a href="brewing.html" target="_blank" >brewed</a> immediately before <a href="drinks.html" target="_blank"> drinking</a>. In most areas, coffee may be purchased unprocessed, or already roasted, or already roasted and ground. Coffee is often vacuum packed to prevent oxidation and lengthen its shelf life.</p>
